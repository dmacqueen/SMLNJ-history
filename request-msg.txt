Greetings SML/NJ People!

I am sending this to people who I believe have been involved with or contributed to the SML/NJ compiler and system (including tools, libraries, important applications). I am writing a (relatively) short and informal history of SML/NJ (the system, not the language), and given the length of time that has passed since this began (Spring 1986) and the falibility and incompleteness of my memory, I am soliciting information from you. I am hoping to complete a first draft before leaving on a trip in mid-April, so your contributions would be most useful if I receive them by the beginning of April.

Here is the sort of info that would be useful:

* When and where were you involved?

* What did you do, or work on?

* Who did you work with?

* Are there any relevant writings available? (publications, tech reports or notes, manuals, etc.)

* Any anecdotes or stories that might be relevant?

* Anyone I have left off my list of people (see attached file people.txt)?

* Anything else I haven't thought of?

Thanks very much for your contributions.  I'm not expecting laborious or time-consuming
research -- just whatever is easily at hand.

Best regards,

Dave
